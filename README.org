  heavily based on Conor McBride's [[https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-17][CS410-17]] and [[https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-18][CS410-18]] classes with some parts taken from the other places

* Installation
  Follow the instructions in the [[https://github.com/yanok/agda-zrh/README.pigworker.md][Original Readme]]

* Key bindings for Emacs
  [[https://github.com/pigworker/CS410-17/lectures/cheat-sheet.txt][Cheat sheet]]

  
** Troubles with some key bindings on Chromebooks
   Some key bindings, most notably C-SPC and C-, and not working on Chromebooks, you might want to remap them to something different.
   TODO: Add elisp snippet.
